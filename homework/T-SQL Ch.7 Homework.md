1. A window function computes a scalar result value against a subset of the rows from the underlying query. 

1. PARTITION restricts the window to the subset of rows that have same values in the partitioning columns as in the current row.

1. ORDER BY in window ordering gives order to rank.

1. ROWS BETWEEN filters a subset of rows between two specified delimiters.

1. You use ranking window functions to rank each row with respect to others in the window. 

1. Offset window functions return an element from a row that is at a certain offset from the current row. 

1. The LAG function looks before the current row, and the LEAD function looks ahead. 

1. FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE return an element from the first and last rows in the window frame.

1. You use an aggregate window function to aggregate the rows in the defined window.

1. A pivot table groups, spreads and aggregates information and presents it on a table.
