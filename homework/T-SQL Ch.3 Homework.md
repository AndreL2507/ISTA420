1. You would need to join tables together if you need to pull data that can't be accessed in just one table. 

1. Inner joins match up rows with the same name in two different tables 

1. Takes info from one table and scrubs it against info from another and only gives out info that matches

1. Combines selected rows from multiple tables into just one table

1. OHIO one inner join, one cross join, (High in the middle) left outer, right outer, full outer. 

1. Composite Joins have multiple join conditions. Selecting from a students table where they have a classid, and a studentid where students will appear multiple times if they are taking different classes. You use a composite join to reference both they studentid and classid from tables class and students. 

1. The first query will count all of the customerid's whereas the second will count all of the orderids.

8. The WHERE clause will evaluate to unknown for outer rows because they have a NULL in the orderdate attribute
