### Chapter 2a T-SQL Homework
----------
1. The orders of the T-SQL Query are:
    1. From
    2. Where
    3. Group By
    4. Having
    5. Select
    6. Order By
      
            

1. The FROM clause specifies the names of the tables you want to query and the table operators that operate on those tables.

1. The WHERE clause specifies a predicate or logical expression to filter the rows returned by the FROM phase.

1. The GROUP BY phase arranges rows returned by the previous logical query processing phase into groups

1. The HAVING clause is a group filter that only evaluates statements that result in TRUE from the HAVING statement.

1. The SELECT clause is where you specify attributes (columns) you want to return in the result table of the query

1. The DISTINCT keyword returns only unique values

1. The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the rows in the output for presentation purposes.

1. The LIMIT clause is used to set a upper limit on the number of tuples returned

1. The TOP filter limits the number or percentage of rows your query returns

1. The OFFSET-FETCH filter is an extension of the ORDER BY clause. The OFFSET clause indicates how many rows to skip and the FETCH clause will indicate how many rows to filter after the skipped rows.
